# STEP 1 
# Specify the STO scanner image where you want to add your certificates
# For a list of all images in the Harness Container Registry, run the following:
#     curl -X  GET https://app.harness.io/registry/_catalog
FROM harness/twistlock-job-runner:latest as scanner

# FYI Root access is required to load and trust certificates
USER root

# STEP 2 
# Copy your certificates to the engine
# You can copy multiple ca from completely different paths into SHARE_CA_PATH
COPY /harness/cert.pem /shared/customer_artifacts/certificates/


# FYI establishes trust for certificates in Python and the OS 
RUN sto_plugin --trust-certs
# Optional: To trust certificates for Java for tools such as
# - Black Duck Hub
# - Checkmarx
# - Sonarqube
# - Veracode
# - NexusIQ
# RUN sh /bin/setup.sh 

# STEP 3 (optional)
# Create a user and assume limited permission user
# If you set this, you need to add runAsUser setting in the scan step
#     i.e., runAsUser: "1000"
USER 1000
